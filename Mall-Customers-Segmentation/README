# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis  
**Clustering (K-Means) | RFM Analysis | Demographic Insights | PCA**

## 📊 Project Overview  
Segmented 200 mall customers into strategic groups using:  
- **K-Means Clustering** (Income, Spending Score, Age)  
- **Adapted RFM Analysis** (Frequency = Spending Score, Monetary = Income)  
- **Demographic Profiling** (Age/Gender vs. Clusters)  
- **3D Visualization** (PCA for dimensionality reduction)  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
1. **High-Value Segment**: Cluster 3 (High Income & High Spending) → 15% of customers, potential 40% revenue.  
2. **Gender Bias**: High spenders are 68% female (mostly Millennials).  
3. **RFM Champions**: 12% customers scored 9+/10 in RFM (target for loyalty programs).  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Python: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Visualization: `Plotly`, `PCA` for 3D clusters  
- Data: [Mall_Customers.csv](link_to_dataset)
